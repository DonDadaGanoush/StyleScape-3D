# StyleScape-3D
StyleScape 3D is intended to be a powerful and intuitive 3D modeling software that will allow users to easily create and design their dream homes and apartments. This is my ongoing Senior project for University and will be continuously updated as changes are made. 

With StyleScape 3D, users will quickly and easily be able to create create detailed floor plans, add furniture and accessories, and visualize their designs in stunning 3D by using 2D floorplans as the basis for the 3D rendered image. The software comes with a large library of pre-designed rooms, furniture, and accessories, allowing users to easily add elements to their designs. Additionally, users can import their own 3D models and textures to create truly unique designs.

One of the standout features of StyleScape 3D is its real-time rendering engine, which allows users to see their designs in photorealistic detail. This means that users can see exactly how their designs will look in real life, allowing them to make changes and adjustments before bringing their designs to life.

Overall, StyleScape 3D is a comprehensive and easy-to-use 3D modeling software that is perfect for home and apartment design. Whether you are a professional designer or a hobbyist, StyleScape 3D has everything you need to bring your home design ideas to life.
